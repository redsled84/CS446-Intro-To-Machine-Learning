## Write-Up

####Question:

Give a brief explanation of the benefit to principal component analysis when dealing with higher dimensional feature vectors.

####Answer:

Higher dimensional feature vectors can be extremely hard to visualize. As PCA can reduce
feature dimensions, it can help aid visualizing a dataset into something more 
interpretable.

####Plotting

I wrote a single helper function named `get_centered_standardized()` which takes
input data Z and returns the centered and standardized result of Z.

The results of plotting are centered and standardized as well.

### Files

`PCA.py` - contains methods for performing principle component analysis
`PlottedPCA.jpg` - screen shot of plotted data

### How to import

`import PCA as pca`
